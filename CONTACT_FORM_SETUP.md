# Contact Form Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ…
Your contact form is now fully functional and will collect submissions through Netlify.

## How to Set Up Email Forwarding

### Option 1: Netlify Forms (Simplest)
1. **Deploy your site** - Push changes to GitHub, Netlify will auto-deploy
2. **Check Forms tab** - In your Netlify dashboard, look for "Forms" tab
3. **Set up notifications** - Look for "Form notifications" or "Email notifications"
4. **Add your email** - Enter `yao.yusi@outlook.com`

### Option 2: Netlify Functions (More Control)
If Option 1 doesn't work, we've created a Netlify function that can send emails.

### Option 3: Third-party Service (Most Reliable)
Use a service like SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES for guaranteed email delivery.

## What Happens Now
1. âœ… Form collects submissions (name, email, subject, message)
