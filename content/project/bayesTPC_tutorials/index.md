## About bayesTPC

The bayesTPC package is an R package designed for Bayesian trait-based modeling of vector-borne disease transmission. As a Research Assistant in the Quantitative Ecology and Disease (QED) Lab, I've contributed to developing comprehensive tutorials and documentation for this package.

## Project Overview

This project involves creating and maintaining up-to-date tutorials for the bayesTPC R package, which serves as a central resource for researchers working on:

- **Bayesian trait-based models** for disease transmission
- **Vector-borne disease research** methodologies
- **Statistical modeling** in ecology and epidemiology
- **Open-source software** documentation and training

## Key Contributions

- **Tutorial Development**: Created comprehensive tutorials covering package functionality
- **Documentation**: Maintained evolving documentation that aggregates materials from various workshops
- **Training Materials**: Contributed to VectorByte Training workshops and EEID training workshops
- **Research Support**: Supported the published paper describing the package

## Impact

The bayesTPC tutorials serve as a central location for researchers to:
- Learn Bayesian modeling approaches
- Access up-to-date package documentation
- Find practical examples and use cases
- Contribute to the growing field of trait-based disease modeling

## Technologies Used

- **R Programming Language**
- **Bayesian Statistics**
- **Markdown Documentation**
- **GitHub Pages**
- **VectorByte Initiative Tools**

This project represents my commitment to open-source research software and making complex statistical methodologies accessible to the broader scientific community.
