üëã Hi, there! I'm **Yusi (Roy) Yao**. A penchant for quantitative finance.
{style="font-size: 1.2rem; background: #FFB76B; background: linear-gradient(to right, #FFB76B 0%, #FFA73D 30%, #FF7C00 60%, #FF7F04 100%); -webkit-background-clip: text; -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;"}

<div class="intro-paragraph">
  <p>I'm a Bachelor of Science student in Statistics with a Data Science option at Virginia Tech, graduating in December 2025. I began my undergraduate studies at the College of the Holy Cross before transferring to Virginia Tech after relocating to Virginia, where I have focused on <strong>Bayesian statistics</strong>, <strong>time series</strong>, <strong>stochastic modeling</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong>, with strong experience in Python, R, and web development.</p>
  
  <p>I am currently a Research Assistant in the <strong>Quantitative Ecology and Disease (QED) Lab</strong>, where I build trait-based Bayesian models to study vector-borne disease transmission and develop open-source tutorials for the VectorByte initiative. I also worked in the <strong>PRIME Lab</strong>, where I integrated real-time code evaluation systems and improved user experience for educational AI platforms. Beyond research, I have gained industry experience through roles at <strong>Citizens Bank</strong> (UX Research Intern), <strong>Ernst & Young</strong> (Strategy Intern), <strong>Hansight Tech</strong> (PM Intern), and in crypto-trading automation projects, where I applied both analytical and software development skills to practical challenges.</p>
  
  <p>Outside of academics and professional work, I enjoy <strong>offshore fishing</strong>, <strong>traveling</strong>, <strong>camping</strong>, and <strong>cooking</strong> ‚Äî hobbies that keep me curious and balanced. You can explore more of my work and projects on my portfolio and GitHub.</p>
